KEYWORD MODIFIERS
       When performing file tagging and searching, keywords can optionally  be
       prefixed  by  a modifier character. These modifiers will change how tag
       interprets the keyword for the specified operation.


   File Tagging
       +KEYWORD (or just KEYWORD)
              Will add the keyword KEYWORD to the specified file  only  if  it
              has not already been added.

       -KEYWORD
              Will  remove the keyword KEYWORD from the specified file only if
              it has already been added.

       :KEYWORD
              Will remove any keyword that contains KEYWORD as a substring.

       .KEYWORD
              Will remove any keyword that does not contains KEYWORD as a sub-
              string.


   File Searching
       +KEYWORD (or just KEYWORD)
              Will return files that contain the keyword KEYWORD

       -KEYWORD
              Will filter out returned files that contain the keyword KEYWORD

       :KEYWORD
              Will  return  files  that  contain the keyword KEYWORD as a sub-
              string.

       .KEYWORD
              Will filter out returned files that contain the keyword  KEYWORD
              as a substring.


   Useful Tricks
       tag -f : DIRECTORY
              Will return all files that have been tagged, inside of DIRECTORY

       tag -f + DIRECTORY
              Will return all files that can hold more tags, inside of  DIREC-
              TORY

       tag -f : - DIRECTORY
              Will  return  all  files  that  cannot hold more tags, inside of
              DIRECTORY

       tag -t : TARGET
              Will remove all keywords associated with TARGET
